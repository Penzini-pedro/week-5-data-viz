## *Story*

By analyizing a dataset of natality in the USA, i was able to create to construct aseries of innsights and view possible risk factores pertaing not only to the current sitaucion but also predict future predicaments we might face.

first i viewed what percentile by state, conformed the population and did an analytical map to view where the death of on born babies was highest.

After i created a dashboard to see what age was it best to have children. Finding that the sweet spot is between 20 - 30.
